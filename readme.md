# MultiBand

MultiBand is a system to control a variety of different music/audio sources in a modular way.

## Modules

For information on how to make a module, visit the docs [here](docs/modules.md).

To add modules to your own setup, clone a module's git repo into the modules directory and start MultiBand.

## Goals

 - Runnable as a daemon in the background
	 - init scripts to integrate with system
 - Fully modular and as solid as possible
